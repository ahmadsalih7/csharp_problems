1. Given a positive integer k, another positive integer n is said to have k-small factors if n can bewritten as a product uv where u and v are both less than k. For instance, 20 has 10-small factorssince both 4 and 5 are less than 10 and 45 = 20. (For the same reason, it is also true to say that 20has 6-small factors, 7-small factors, 8-small factors, etc). However, 22 does not have 10-smallfactors since the only way to factor 22 is as 22 = 2 * 11, and 11 is not less than 10.
Write a function hasKSmallFactors with signatuare boolean hasKSmallFactors(int k, int n)which returns true if n has k-small factors. The function should return false if either k or n is notpositive.
Examples:
hasKSmallFactors(7, 30) is true 
(since 56 = 30 and 5 < 7, 6 < 7).

hasKSmallFactors(6, 14) is false
 (since the only way to factor 14 is 27 = 14 and 7 not less than 6)
 
 hasKSmallFactors(6, 30) is false 
 
 (since 5*6 = 30, 6 not less than 6; 3 * 10 = 30, 10 not less than 6; 2 *15 = 30, 15 not less than 6).
 
 2.
 An integer is defined to be an even subset of another integer n if every even factor of m is also afactor of n.
  For example 18 is an even subset of 12
   because the even factors of 18 are 2 and 6 andthese are both factors of 12.
   
    But 18 is not an even subset of 32
     because 6 is not a factor of 32.
     
     Write a function with signature int isEvenSubset(int m, int n) that returns 1 if m is an even subsetof n, otherwise it returns 0.


A twinoid is defined to be an array that has exactly two even values that are adjacent to oneanother. For example {3, 3, 2, 6, 7} is a twinoid array because it has exactly two even values (2 and6) and they are adjacent to one another. The following arrays are not twinoid arrays.{3, 3, 2, 6, 6, 7} because it has three even values.{3, 3, 2, 7, 6, 7} because the even values are not adjacent to one another{3, 8, 5, 7, 3} because it has only one even value.Write a function named isTwinoid that returns 1 if its array argument is a twinoid array. Otherwiseit returns 0.If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is int isTwinoid (int [ ] a);If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature isint isTwinoid(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array.


A balanced array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, -n also is in thearray. For example {-2, 3, 2, -3} is a balanced array. So is {-2, 2, 2, 2}. But {-5, 2, -2} is notbecause 5 is not in the array.Write a function named isBalanced that returns 1 if its array argument is a balanced array.Otherwise it returns 0.If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature isint isBalanced (int [ ] a);If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature isint isBalanced(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array.




An Sub array is defined to be an array in which each element is greater than sum of allelements after that. See examples below:{13, 6, 3, 2} is a Sub array. Note that 13 > 2 + 3 + 6, 6 > 3 + 2, 3 > 2.{11, 5, 3, 2} is a NOT a Sub array. Note that 5 is not greater than 3 + 2.Write a function named isSub that returns 1 if its array argument is a Sub array, otherwiseit returns 0.If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is:int isSub (int [ ] a)If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is:int isSub (int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array.
